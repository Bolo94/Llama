Hi Everybody! On wednesday I will help get people aqcuainted with GIT. don't worry about creating branches or anything for now.


The Llama web app

There are 3 branches

Master.

back-end.

front-end.

All features will be merged to their corresponding branch and given a corresponding name beginning with feature/. For example while working on the back-end code for login I will create a branch named feature/back-end-login. When that feature is complete I will merge the changes into backend. The backend branch will then be merged with master when stable.
