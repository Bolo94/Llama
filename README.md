Hi Everybody! On wednesday I will help get people aqcuainted with GIT. don't worry about creating branches or anything for now.


The Llama web app

There are 4 branches

Master.

Staging.

back-end.

front-end.


All backend features will make pull requests to backend. All frontend features will make pull requests to frontebd. Backend and frontend will make pull requests only to staging. Staging will make pull requests to master.

All features will be merged to their corresponding branch and given a corresponding name beginning with feature/. For example while working on the back-end code for login I will create a branch named feature/back-end-login. When that feature is complete I will merge the changes into backend. The backend branch will then be merged with master when stable.
